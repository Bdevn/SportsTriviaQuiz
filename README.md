I originally reviewed this faced paced HTML, CSS, and Javascript based course as a refresher to Js. During the course I was introduced to Fetch APIs and plan on using the app to improve my Js skills by adding features and functionality over time.

Thank you much James!

The front-end graphic design is mostly mine. I chose sports for this app with my Dad and brother in mind :0)

Enjoy!
